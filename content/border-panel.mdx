# Overview

The BorderPanel is a layout component in TypeComposer that divides the screen into distinct regions: top, left, right, bottom, and center. It comes with two layout variants ('primary' and 'secondary'), which define the arrangement of these regions.

## 1. Key Features

- Provides a flexible, structured layout divided into five regions: top, left, right, bottom, and center.
- Supports two layout variants: 'primary' (default) and 'secondary'.
- Easily customizable through properties for styling and behavior.

## 2. Variants

### Primary (default)

The 'primary' variant arranges the regions in a typical top-bottom-left-right-center order, where the top, left, and right regions surround the central content.

### Secondary

The 'secondary' variant places the left and right regions next to the center, while the top and bottom regions remain above and below, respectively.

## 3. Basic Example

```javascript
import { BorderPanel } from "typecomposer";
		
export class AppPage extends BorderPanel {
	constructor() {
	super({
		variant: "primary", // Use 'secondary' for an alternative layout
		className: "w-screen h-screen overflow-hidden",
	});
	this.top = new NavBar();
	this.left = new Sidebar();
	this.center = new RouteView({ className: "overflow-hidden w-full h-full" });
	}
}
```

## 4. Properties

| Property | Type | Description | Example |

| variant | `"primary" \| "secondary"` | Defines the layout variant. Defaults to 'primary'. | `"secondary"` |
| className | string (optional) | CSS classes applied to the BorderPanel for styling. | `"w-screen h-screen overflow-hidden"` |
| top | Element (optional) | The element to be displayed in the top region. | `new NavBar()` |
| left | Element (optional) | The element to be displayed in the left region. | `new Sidebar()` |
| right | Element (optional) | The element to be displayed in the right region. | `new WidgetPanel()` |
| bottom | Element (optional) | The element to be displayed in the bottom region. | `new Footer()` |

## 5. Examples

### Primary Layout Example

```javascript
new BorderPanel({
	variant: "primary",
	className: "w-screen h-screen",
	top: new NavBar(),
	left: new Sidebar(),
	center: new RouteView({ className: "w-full h-full" }),
	right: new WidgetPanel(),
	bottom: new Footer(),
});
```

### Secondary Layout Example

```javascript
new BorderPanel({
	variant: "secondary",
	className: "w-screen h-screen",
	top: new NavBar(),
	left: new Sidebar(),
	center: new RouteView({ className: "w-full h-full" }),
	right: new WidgetPanel(),
	bottom: new Footer(),
});
```

## 6. Default Behavior

By default, the BorderPanel uses the 'primary' variant and arranges its regions accordingly.
If no regions (e.g., top, left, right, bottom, center) are provided, the corresponding area will simply remain empty.

## 7. When to Use BorderPanel

- When you need a structured layout with defined regions for top, left, right, bottom, and center areas.
- When your application requires consistent layouts with minimal customization effort.
- When you want a layout that can dynamically adapt to different content regions.

## Conclusion

The BorderPanel is a powerful layout component for creating structured, multi-region layouts in TypeComposer. With its two layout variants ('primary' and 'secondary') and easy-to-customize properties, it provides a flexible solution for building complex UI layouts with minimal code.
