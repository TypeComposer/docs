## Span Element

The SpanElement is a core component in TypeComposer designed to facilitate inline text styling and behavior customization. It extends the standard HTML span element, allowing developers to define text, styles, and events declaratively through properties. This makes SpanElement ideal for dynamic UIs, where inline elements need to adapt to user interactions or data changes.

## 1. Key Features

The following are the core features of this component:
- Text Content: Easily define inline text using the `text` property.
- Flexible Styling: Customize appearance with `className`, `style`, `color`, `fontSize`, and other properties.
- Interactive Events: Attach event handlers like `onclick`, `onhover`, and `ondblclick` to handle user interactions dynamically.
- Seamless Integration: Designed to work smoothly within layouts and can be nested inside other components for advanced use cases.
- Accessibility Support: Implements attributes like `aria-label` to enhance compatibility with screen readers and improve usability.

## 2. Common Use Cases

- Highlighting specific words or phrases within a block of text.
- Applying inline styles to small pieces of content.
- Adding tooltips, hover effects, or click events to text snippets.
- Dynamically updating inline text based on user actions or data.

## 3. Detailed Example

```typescript
import { SpanElement } from "typecomposer";

class StyledSpan extends SpanElement {
	constructor() {
	super({
		text: "Click me!",
		className: "text-green-600 font-bold hover:text-green-800 transition-all cursor-pointer",
		style: { padding: "5px", borderRadius: "4px", border: "1px solid green" },
		onclick: () => alert("Span clicked!"),
	});
	}
}

export default StyledSpan;
```

## 4. Advanced Configuration

The SpanElement supports additional properties to meet more complex requirements. Below are some advanced configurations:
- **Dynamic Content:** Combine `text` with variables or state management tools to display dynamic data.
- **Custom Events:** Define your own event handlers using properties like `onmouseenter` or `onmouseleave`.
- **CSS Modules or Tailwind:** Use `className` to leverage external styling libraries like Tailwind or CSS modules for consistent design.
- **Accessibility Attributes:** Add attributes such as `role`, `tabindex`, and `aria-hidden` to improve the component's accessibility.

## 5. Accessibility Best Practices

To ensure that your SpanElement is accessible to all users, consider the following:
- Use `aria-label` or `title` attributes to provide context for screen readers.
- Avoid using `onclick` without an accessible equivalent for keyboard or screen reader users.
- Test the component with assistive technologies to verify proper functionality.

## 6. Full Example with Accessibility and Dynamic Behavior

```typescript
import { SpanElement } from "typecomposer";

class AccessibleDynamicSpan extends SpanElement {
	constructor() {
	super({
		text: "Hover or click me!",
		className: "text-purple-500 hover:underline focus:outline focus:ring-2 focus:ring-purple-300",
		style: { padding: "8px", display: "inline-block" },
		onclick: () => alert("You clicked the span!"),
		onhover: () => console.log("Hovered over span"),
		ariaLabel: "Interactive span example",
		tabindex: "0",
	});
	}
}

export default AccessibleDynamicSpan;
```

## 7. Conclusion

The SpanElement in TypeComposer is a powerful tool for creating highly customizable inline text elements. Its property-driven design allows for seamless styling, event handling, and accessibility, making it an essential component for modern web development.
