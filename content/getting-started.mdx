# Getting Started

To create a new project using TypeComposer, follow these steps:

## Create a New Project

Use the official TypeComposer project initializer:

```bash
npm create typecomposer@latest
```

Follow the prompts:

- **Select the template you want**: Project or Library.
- **Choose the language**: TypeScript, TypeScript + TailwindCSS, or JavaScript.
- **Enter the project name**.
- **Decide whether to include a router** (optional).

Once the setup is complete, navigate to your project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd <project-name>
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Example

For instance, to create a new TypeScript project named typecomposer-project without a router:

```bash
npm create typecomposer@latest
```

**Prompts:**
```
Template: Project
Language: TypeScript
Project Name: typecomposer-project
Router: no
```

**Commands:**
```bash
cd typecomposer-project
npm install
npm start
```

Don't worry if you're new to TypeComposer! Start by creating components and building your application gradually. Dive into advanced features as you get more comfortable.
