# Overview

TypeComposer is a framework for building web user interfaces using native web standards. It emphasizes a class-based approach where components are defined as ES6 classes extending HTMLElement. This structure leverages native browser APIs, resulting in efficient, streamlined JavaScript code.

```javascript
import { Component, ButtonElement } from 'typecomposer';
		
export class AppPage extends Component {
	constructor() {
	super();

	const button = new ButtonElement({ text: 'Click me' });
	button.onclick = () => alert('Welcome to TypeComposer!');
	button.style.fontSize = '4em';

	this.append(button);
	}
}
```

In TypeComposer, components can range from simple reusable elements to complete web applications, ensuring flexibility and scalability. Styles, event listeners, and logic are applied directly, maintaining full control over the DOM.

# Features

- **Declarative Design**: Components are defined using JavaScript classes, focusing on clean and maintainable code.
- **Native Performance**: Built directly on web platform standards without extra runtime abstractions.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for creating everything from small widgets to comprehensive web apps.
- **Integrated Component Registration**: Components are automatically registered with the browser using customElements.
