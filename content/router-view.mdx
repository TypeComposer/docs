# Overview

The RouteView component is a dynamic routing element in TypeComposer that automatically updates its view based on the application's active route. It listens for route changes and renders the corresponding component.

- Automatically updates when the route changes.
- Supports default views when no matching route is found.
- Allows custom logic through event-driven updates.

## Usage

### Basic Example

```javascript
import { RouteView, Component } from "typecomposer";

class NotFoundComponent extends Component {
	onInit() {
		this.append("Not Found");
	}
}

export class MyApp extends Component {
	constructor() {
		super();
		this.append(new RouteView({
			defaultView: NotFoundComponent,
			onUpdateView: (view) => console.log("New view loaded:", view),
		}));
	}
}
```

In this example, `RouteView` is placed inside `AppPage`, which acts as the main container for managing the application layout and routing logic. The `defaultView` is displayed when no matching route is found.

## Properties

### 1. defaultView

Defines the default component to be displayed when no matching route is found.

```javascript
new RouteView({
	defaultView: NotFoundComponent,
});
```

### 2. onUpdateView

Callback function that is triggered whenever the view changes.

```javascript
new RouteView({
	onUpdateView: (view) => console.log("Current view:", view),
});
```

### 3. view

Holds the currently rendered component inside `RouteView`.

## Lifecycle Methods

### connectedCallback()

Automatically called when the component is added to the DOM. Initializes and updates the view based on the current route.

### disconnectedCallback()

Automatically called when the component is removed from the DOM. Cleans up route watchers to prevent memory leaks.

## Default Behavior

By default, RouteView:

- Renders the appropriate component based on the active route.
- Falls back to `defaultView` if no route matches.
- Removes the previous component when switching views.

## When to Use RouteView

- When you need dynamic view updates based on routing.
- To manage component-based navigation within a TypeComposer application.
- To handle dynamic page rendering without manually managing component mounting/unmounting.

## Conclusion

The RouteView component is an essential tool for handling dynamic routing in TypeComposer. By automatically updating the displayed component based on the current route, it simplifies navigation management and ensures a seamless user experience.
